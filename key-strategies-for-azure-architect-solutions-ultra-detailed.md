       - Receive security recommendations and alerts

## 5. Optimize for Cost Management
   - **Use Azure Cost Management and Billing Tools**
       - Monitor spending and resource usage
       - Set up budgets and cost alerts
   - **Implement Cost Optimization Strategies**
       - Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
       - Right-size resources based on usage patterns
       - Implement auto-shutdown policies for non-production environments
   - **Leverage Azure Advisor for Cost-Saving Recommendations**
       - Review and implement cost-saving suggestions
       - Optimize resource utilization
   - **Implement Tagging for Cost Tracking and Resource Management**
       - Apply tags to resources for cost allocation
       - Use tags for resource grouping and management

## 6. Design for Performance Efficiency
   - **Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights**
       - Monitor application performance and health
       - Set up alerts for performance issues
   - **Implement Caching Strategies with Azure Cache for Redis**
       - Cache frequently accessed data
       - Reduce latency and improve response times
   - **Optimize Database Performance**
       - Use indexing and query optimization
       - Implement partitioning and sharding
   - **Use Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
       - Distribute content to edge locations
       - Reduce latency for global users

## 7. Embrace DevOps Practices
   - **Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
       - Use Azure DevOps Pipelines for automation
       - Integrate with source control systems (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos)
   - **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
       - Define infrastructure using ARM templates or Terraform
       - Version control infrastructure code
   - **Automate Testing and Deployment Processes**
       - Implement automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
       - Use deployment gates and approvals
   - **Monitor and Optimize DevOps Pipelines**
       - Track pipeline performance and failures
       - Optimize build and release processes

## 8. Ensure Data Protection and Compliance
